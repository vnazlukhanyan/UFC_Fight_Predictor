# UFC Fight Predictor

## Description and Data
I love MMA and have always wanted to perform a data science project on my favorite sport!
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset

## Research Questions
How accurately could we predict who wins a fight in the UFC given a variety of fighter features? 
What are the most important factors/features that lead to a fighter securing a win?

## Hypothesis
The most important features should be the most obvious: a fighter's fight record, their age, and higher average strikes, submissions, and takedowns. I will perform a feature importance criterion to assess this hypothesis.
